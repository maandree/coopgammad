NAME
	coopgammad - Cooperative gamma server

SYNOPSIS
	coopgammad [-m method] [-s site] [-fkpq]

DESCRIPTION
	Programs that desire to change the gamma adjustment
	on a display should use this program instead of
	talking directly with the display server (unless
	the display server is mds). By doing this, multiple
	programs can add filters to the display without
	overriding each others effects.

	By using coopgammad to apply adjustments, you can
	select whether the adjustment is persistent or
	shall be removed when your program disconnects
	from coopgammad. Even if the adjustment is persistent
	it can be modified or removed later by another
	process.

OPTIONS
	-f
		Don't fork the process to the background.
		If used, you can still detect when the
		process has been initialised be waiting
		for its stdout to close.

	-k
		Do not close stderr when forking to the
		background.

	-m METHOD
		Adjustment method name or number. Recognised
		names include:

		dummy      Dummy method
		randr      X RAndR
		vidmode    X VidMode
		drm        Linux DRM
		gdi        Windows GDI
		quartz     Quartz Core Graphics

		The adjustment methods are supported via
		libgamma(7). Only methods that were enabled
		when libgamma as compiled will be supported.

	-p
		Add the current gamma adjustments to the
		filter list at priority 0. Even if this
		is not used, the gamma adjustments will
		not change for an output until a filter
		has been added for that output.

	-q
		If used once, print the selected adjustment
		method for the first line to stdout, and
		if site's have names for that method, print
		the name of the selected site on the second
		line to stdout. The second line can be omitted
		if -s has not been used and the default site
		cannot be find.

		If used at least twice, print the pathname
		of the socket for the select method and site
		combination to stdout. Under unusual
		circumstances, the path may contain LF
		characters, but it will always be terminated
		by one extra LF to mark the end of the
		printed line.

	-s SITE
		Select the site to which to connect.
		For example ':0', for local display 0 when
		using X.

SIGNALS
	SIGUSR1
		Reexecute the process to an updated version.

	SIGRTMIN+0
		Disconnect from the display server or
		graphics card.

	SIGRTMIN+1
		Reconnect to the display server or graphics
		card.

RATIONALE
	After reading the description section, the need for
	this should be obvious.

	I plan to reuse code written for this program when
	implementing mds-coopgamma(1), therefore, the
	protocol is overly complicated, implementation-wise.
